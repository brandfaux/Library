  <h1>POETRY</h1>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    In the dance of dawn's first light, we seek,<br>
    The essence of existence, so unique.<br>
    In whispers of the wind and the song of the sea,<br>
    Lies the riddle of life's mystery.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is the meaning that we pursue?<br>
    In every heartbeat, a clue imbued.<br>
    Through laughter and tears, joy and strife,<br>
    We navigate the labyrinth of life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it in love's tender embrace we find,<br>
    The purpose that eternally binds?<br>
    Or in the quest for knowledge vast,<br>
    Do we uncover truth at last?
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps it dwells in acts of grace,<br>
    In kindness shown in every place.<br>
    Or in the courage to stand tall and strong,<br>
    Against the currents that pull us along.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, amidst the chaos and the strife,<br>
    We glimpse the beauty of this life.<br>
    In moments fleeting, yet profound,<br>
    The meaning of life is found.
  </p>
  <p>
    For in the journey, not the end,<br>
    We discover treasures, round each bend.<br>
    In connections forged, in dreams pursued,<br>
    In the simple joys, in gratitude.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let us cherish each passing day,<br>
    Embrace the mystery, come what may.<br>
    For in the tapestry of joy and sorrow,<br>
    Lies the meaning we'll find tomorrow.
  </p>
